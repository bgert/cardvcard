    "This is very easy code to write (I swiped all of it from the web), and it executes very quickly. It is obviously more efficient and simpler than using an LLM for the purpose of validating credit card numbers, however, it requires that someone know python (or coding in general). The directions for verifying a credit card number have been expressed in plain english above, and a person could be given those instructions and verify credit card numbers, no python necessary. A person with no technical expertise could also give these guidelines to an LLM and ask the LLM to verify credit card numbers. There are products coming onto the market that abstract away all the implementation and deployment steps of setting up an LLM to do something, and allow you to create processes out of LLM blocks, passing the output of one in as the input to the next. Rather than each block executing computer code, each block queries an LLM with instructions that can be given in human language. This empowers the non-technical to build functions that can automate tasks. We are going to explore whether an LLM can capably validate CC numbers given instructions in english. We will also see if an LLM can generate a valid CC number given instructions in english."
